## Central processing unit

A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor, is the primary processor in a given computer.Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations.This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs)

Most modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, with one or more CPUs on a single IC chip. Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are called multi-core processors. The individual physical CPUs, called processor cores, can also be multithreaded to support CPU-level multithreading

The fundamental operation of most CPUs, regardless of the physical form they take, is to execute a sequence of stored instructions that is called a program.The instructions to be executed are kept in some kind of computer memory. Nearly all CPUs follow the fetch, decode and execute steps in their operation, which are collectively known as the instruction cycle.

## Fetch

Fetch involves retrieving an instruction (which is represented by a number or sequence of numbers) from program memory. The instruction's location (address) in program memory is determined by the program counter (PC; called the "instruction pointer" in Intel x86 microprocessors), which stores a number that identifies the address of the next instruction to be fetched. After an instruction is fetched, the PC is incremented by the length of the instruction so that it will contain the address of the next instruction in the sequence.Often, the instruction to be fetched must be retrieved from relatively slow memory, causing the CPU to stall while waiting for the instruction to be returned. This issue is largely addressed in modern processors by caches and pipeline architectures.

## Decode

The instruction that the CPU fetches from memory determines what the CPU will do. In the decode step, performed by binary decoder circuitry known as the instruction decoder, the instruction is converted into signals that control other parts of the CPU.

The way in which the instruction is interpreted is defined by the CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA).Often, one group of bits (that is, a "field") within the instruction, called the opcode, indicates which operation is to be performed, while the remaining fields usually provide supplemental information required for the operation, such as the operands. Those operands may be specified as a constant value (called an immediate value), or as the location of a value that may be a processor register or a memory address, as determined by some addressing mode.

In some CPU designs, the instruction decoder is implemented as a hardwired, unchangeable binary decoder circuit. In others, a microprogram is used to translate instructions into sets of CPU configuration signals that are applied sequentially over multiple clock pulses. In some cases the memory that stores the microprogram is rewritable, making it possible to change the way in which the CPU decodes instructions.

## Execute

After the fetch and decode steps, the execute step is performed. Depending on the CPU architecture, this may consist of a single action or a sequence of actions. During each action, control signals electrically enable or disable various parts of the CPU so they can perform all or part of the desired operation. The action is then completed, typically in response to a clock pulse. Very often the results are written to an internal CPU register for quick access by subsequent instructions. In other cases results may be written to slower, but less expensive and higher capacity main memory.

For example, if an instruction that performs addition is to be executed, registers containing operands (numbers to be summed) are activated, as are the parts of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that perform addition. When the clock pulse occurs, the operands flow from the source registers into the ALU, and the sum appears at its output. On subsequent clock pulses, other components are enabled (and disabled) to move the output (the sum of the operation) to storage (e.g., a register or memory). If the resulting sum is too large (i.e., it is larger than the ALU's output word size), an arithmetic overflow flag will be set, influencing the next operation.

## Processor

In **computing** and **computer science**, a **processor** or processing unit is an electrical component **(digital circuit)** that performs operations on an external data source, usually **memory** or some other data stream. It typically takes the form of a **microprocessor**, which can be implemented on a single or a few tightly integrated **metal–oxide–semiconductor integrated circuit chips**. In the past, processors were constructed using multiple individual vacuum tubes, multiple individual transistors, or multiple integrated circuits.

## Computer Science

Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines to applied disciplines.

## digital circuit

In theoretical computer science, a circuit is a model of computation in which input values proceed through a sequence of gates, each of which computes a function.

## Microprocessor

A microprocessor is a computer processor for which the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), or a small number of ICs. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output.

## metal–oxide–semiconductor

In electronics, the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor is a type of field-effect transistor (FET), most commonly fabricated by the controlled oxidation of silicon. It has an insulated gate, the voltage of which determines the conductivity of the device

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer, responsible for:

- Fetching instructions
- Decoding them
- Executing them
- Storing the result

## High-Level Structure of the CPU

1. . Control Unit (CU) 🕹️

- Directs the operation of the processor.
- Fetches, decodes instructions, and tells other units what to do.

2.  Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) ➕➖✖️
    -Performs arithmetic and logical operations.

3.  Registers 📦

- Small, fast memory inside the CPU (like accumulator, PC, etc.)
- Temporarily stores data, instructions, or addresses.

4. Program Counter (PC) ⏩

- Holds the memory address of the next instruction.

5.  Instruction Register (IR) 🧾

- Holds the currently executing instruction.

6.  Cache 🗃️

- Small, fast memory between CPU and RAM.
- Holds frequently used data or instructions.

7. Buses

Wires that carry data and signals

- **Data Bus** – transfers actual data
- **Address Bus**– transfers addresses
- **Control Bus** – carries control signals

## The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle (Instruction Cycle)

Let’s see how a single instruction moves through the CPU:

1. . Fetch 🏃‍♂️

- The PC points to the next instruction in memory (RAM).
- This address is sent over the address bus.
- The instruction is fetched and stored in the Instruction Register (IR).
- PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.

2. Decode 🔍

- The Control Unit decodes the instruction stored in the IR.
- It figures out what needs to be done.
- Determines if it involves the ALU, memory, or a register.

3. Execute ⚙️
   The CU signals the appropriate part:

- If it's an arithmetic operation → send operands to ALU.
- ALU performs the calculation.
- The result is stored in a register or sent to memory.
- Flags might be updated (zero, carry, etc.).

4. Repeat

- Go back to Fetch the next instruction.

## 🔄 Example Instruction Execution

Let's say this instruction is in memory:

```cpp
ADD R1, R2  → // R1 = R1 + R2
```

Here's how CPU executes it:
**Step** | **Action**
Fetch | PC fetches ADD R1, R2 into IR
Decode | CU decodes: need ALU, get R1 & R2
Execute | ALU adds R1 + R2, stores in R1

# What is a Core?

A core is an individual processing unit inside a CPU (Central Processing Unit). It can independently execute instructions.
✅ Simple Definition:
| One core = one worker that can execute one task (or thread) at a time.
Modern CPUs often have multiple cores (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...), which means multiple instructions can run simultaneously — this is called parallelism or concurrent execution.

## 🛠️ Role of a Core in the Operating System

The OS uses cores to run:

- Your applications (e.g., browser, code editor)
- System processes (background services, drivers, etc.)
- Threads of a program (e.g., image loading, UI rendering, etc.)

The OS acts like a scheduler 👇
**Core** **What OS might assign**
Core 1 -> Handle browser tab
Core 2 -> Handle video playing
Core 3 -> Run antivirus scan
Core 4 -> Handle system updates

## 🔄 Example:

Let’s say you open VS Code, Chrome, and Spotify at once:

- The OS sees that there are 3 applications to run.
- If you have a quad-core CPU, the OS can assign:
- Chrome to Core 1
- VS Code to Core 2
- Spotify to Core 3
- Meanwhile, Core 4 is free for background processes.

## ⚙️ Core vs Thread vs Process

**Term** **Description**
Core -> Physical hardware inside CPU
Process -> Running instance of a program
Thread -> A smaller unit of a process; runs on a core

### 🧠 Each thread runs on a core.

If you have 8 threads and 4 cores, the OS will schedule 2 threads per core (context switching happens).

**Multicore = Faster?**
✅ Yes, but not always.

- More cores help only if:
- Your programs or tasks are multi-threaded.
- The OS can distribute tasks well.
- You’re doing parallel-heavy work (e.g., video editing, backend servers, ML training)
